Frog Wars
This pond ain't big enough for the two of them.  The black frog and the green frog are both hungry, 
but nature does not wait for the weak.  Now they are locked in an intense competition to eat more 
flies than the other frog.

How to play:
Rules:
	Eat more flies than the other player.  To eat a fly, aim your tongue, then charge your tongue 
by holding the charge button.  The longer you charge, the farther your tongue will launch.  Flies are 
worth 1 point, but flies that are eaten at least 75% of the way across the screen are worth 3 points.
Multiple flies can be eaten in one shot.
   
Dragonflies will also appear, and these are worth 2 points.  If you eat a dragonfly, your frog gains 
a fireball attack.  You can shoot a fireball at the other frog with the fireball button, which will 
stun it for 2 seconds.  

Each game will last 60 seconds.
